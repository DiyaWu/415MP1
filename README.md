The health bar is displayed on the upper left corner with a maximum value of 10. The game will restart when the health remaining is zero.  
The score is displayed below health bar. It will increase when you pass through the hole or shoot an enemy.  
The health pack is an orange circle object. When you collide with it, your life will increase by one. It will also update the health bar. If you don't collide with the health pack, it will disappear after you pass through. At most one health pack is generated in each tunnel.  
The bullet is a yeallow small point which can be used to shoot enemies. It is created by mouse click.
